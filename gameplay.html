                        Like previous Dragon Age games, Dragon Age Inquisition is a dark-fantasy, 3rd person action rpg, playable as one protagonist and three of nine interchangaeble AI companions (which the player can take control of at will)

                    <p>
                        Although touted as an "open world" game, Dragon Age Inquisition is not open world the same way The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Intead it simply features larger locations (than it's predecessors) with more exploration freedom. It is also the first in the game series to feature mounts.

                        The dialogue wheel, first introduced in Dragon Age II, returns. The wheel displays the type of emotion that matches your dialogue choice.

                        The player character can be one of three classes: Warrior, Rogue, or Mage, which three specialization for each available in the game. The player can choose one of 4 playable races - human, elf, dwarf, or qunari - of either male or female. Players cannot customize their character's physique, as the game engine supports differing body shapes for each race. Two voice sets are available for each gender.

                        Like in previous titles, players can recruit companions. A total of 9 companions can be recruited, and all companions can be customized via armor and in-class weapon style. It is also possible for companions to leave the party if approval ratings are too low. It is also possible for the companions to betray the inquisitor depending on the choices made by the player.

                        Another part of dragon age inquisition's gameplay involves obtaining and mainttaining power in various regions. This is done through a number of methods, such as sealing rifts, aquiring strongholds, etc.

                        Combat in Dragon Age Inquisition combines the combat of both Dragon Age Origins and Dragon Age II, allwowing players to pick between an action approach, or a strategic one, or a hybrid of the two. Environemts may be manipulated and exploited to a greater degree than previous titles.
