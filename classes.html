                    <p>
                        Battle-hardened and masters of close combat, warriors are pivotal to any group entering battle. As front-line fighters, they absorb the brunt of opponent attacks, steal enemy focus, and create an opening for deadly ranged assaults from other classes. While some warriors prefer visceral, sweeping damage, many are silverite-clad bulwarks, weathering any blows they don’t deflect with their shields.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>Abilities</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Weapon and Shield</h3>
                    
                    <p>
                        You stay on your feet after punishment that would kill your allies. Use your shields to protect yourself and stagger your enemies
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Two-Handed Weapon</h3>
                    
                    <p>
                        Crush your opponents with massive blows that can break any guard, shatter any armor, and destroy any opponent.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Battlemaster</h3>
                    
                    <p>
                        Control the battlefield and everyone in it. Bolster your allies, hamper your enemies, and take advantage of any sign of weakness.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Vaguard</h3>
                    
                    <p>
                        Protect your allies by making yourself the biggest target on the battlefield. When enemies take the bait, you pick then apart with brutal precision.

                    <p>
                        Defenders and protectors. When a warrior trains in the champion’s tradition, he or she can become unstoppable. Champions use their armor, weapon and awareness to shrug off incoming attacks while holding critical positions on the battlefield and protecting allies in the process.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Reaver</h3>

                        Armed with bows, daggers, and any number of dirty tricks, the rogue’s primary focus is damage: tearing foes down one at a time with systematic efficiency. Rogues commonly use a mixture of stealth and mobility to reach positions of advantage, be it a sniper’s perch away from enemy blades or behind an unsuspecting mage. Deadly and resourceful, rogues can tip the balance of any strategic assault.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Masters of ranged combat. These rogues avoid enemies that attempt to get close, put arrows or bolts through multiple foes, and even unleash explosive shots to devestating effect.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Sabotage</h3>
                    
                    <p>
                        These rogues specialize in poisons and traps. Their dirty tricks leaves enemies sick and limping, easy pickings for a sharp blade, or a barbed arrow.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Subterfuge</h3>

                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>Specializations</h2>

                        Assassins make death into an art form. These rogues specialize in quick, deadly kills that let them slide back into the shadows undetected, or indirect kills that eliminate targets while the assassin is safely away.

                    <h3>Tempest</h3>
                    
                    <p>
                        These rogues specialize in using alchemic mixtures that wreathe them in frost or flame. Fast and chaotic, they wade innto the fight and dare enemies to face the storm.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Those who can tap into the raw energy of the Fade and block the whispering temptations of demons are truly exceptional. When they turn that mental focus onto the field of war, they can be truly terrifying opponents. Rains of fire, walls of ice, or even the ability to heal allies make up a mage's toolkit. Most employ considerable skills rendering foes not only weakened, but also vulnerable to physical attacks, setting up opportunities for their teammates to exploit.
