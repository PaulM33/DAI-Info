                        Dragon Age Inquisition includes a four player co-op mode which features multiple campaigns and maps which are randomly generated with mathed between 20 - 30 minutes. There are many heroes to choose from. All have distinct looks and abilities. The player will be an agent of the inquisition, running behind the scenes operations.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        There is no subsscription or premium services. Player's can, however, purchase a platnium, which is described as a "time saver currency.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h1>Gameplay</h1>
                    
                    <p>
                        Each player assumes the role of one of a group of Inquisition agents displatched to eliminate either a cohort of Venatori, a battalion of Red Templars, or a pack of Demons that have taken control of an area.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        There are 5 zones on each area, chosen at random from various configurations. Once the first four zones have been  cleared, players will face a fifth wave of enemies led by the enemy commander. Once the final wave of enemies has been killed, the match end victoriously.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>There are three levels of difficulty: </p>
                    
                    <p>Routine: rcommended for players levels 1 - 8</p>
                    
                    <p>Threatening: recommended for players levels 8 - 16</p>
                    
                    <p>Perilous: recommended for players levels 16 and up</p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Players can use abilities and potions to heal themselves. If a player's health drops to 0, they are incapacitated and unable to fight. Another player who is not incapacitated must revive an incapacitated player, or else the incapacitated player will bleed out and die. If a player dies, they can only observe the match, but cannot interact in any way. Once the surving players clear a wave of enemies, a dead player will be revived. However, players can only be incapacitated 3 times a match.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Each location contain loots, treasure chests and sealed off alcoves generated at random. The alcoves can be opened by either a mage, rogue, or warrior depending on which lock is randomly generated.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Gold can be traded at the store section for treasure chests or potion chests which randomly grant new items, armours, runes and potions.

                        Occationally, when a player reaches a new zone, an event will activate which adds an optioal objective for that section. There are four different event types, each with minor variations:
