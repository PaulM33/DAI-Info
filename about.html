                    <h1>Plot</h1>
                    
                    <p>
                        The game takes place one year after the events of Dragon Age II. The continent of Thedas is in chaos. Orlais is undergoing a civil war. The Circle of Magi have rebelled against the oppressive templars in a bid for independence. The Templar Order have broken off from the chantry to oppose the mages and anyone who stand in their way, leading to an all out war.

                    <p>
                        In a last effort for peace, Divine Justinia V orchestrates a peace summit between the ambassadors of the templars and the rebel mages, for the purpose of negotiating a peaceful compromise. An explotion occurs, killing the attendants of the conclave, and creating a tear in the veil, allowing demons to invade.

                    <p>
                        The player is the sole survivor of the explosion, and is granted the ability to seal the tears in the veil, leading many to believe the player as a messiah sent to save the world. With this, the player is inducted into the inquisition, eventually becoming it's inquisitor, and charged with the task or restoring order to the world.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h1>Data Transfer and World-States</h1>
                    
                    <p>
                        Players are able to create their own specific canon and customize important decisions from previous games ina cloud-based application called Dragon Age Keep. The Keep aims to allow players to customize cross-generational and cross-console world-states, ideally circumventing important bugs and other issues that have occurred when importing save-games in other titles.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Players who do not, or choose not to, import a world-state will be provided with a default world-state which is designed in a manner that players new to the game will not be overwhelmed.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Players cannot directly import save files from previous games into the keep. However, Dragon Age Inuqisition save files will import into the keep when you're online while playing (or next time you go online)
