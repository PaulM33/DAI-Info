                        Development of Dragon Age Inquisition began prior to the release of Dragon Age II. It was proginally supposed to be a multiplayer-only game, codenamed "Blackfoot". The game differs somewhat from it's predecessors, introducing new features and combining elements of earlier installments in the series into the game.

                        Combat focuses more ona player's ability to prepare, position and form a cohesive team with their party members, requiring more tactical thinking. The armor customization also differs from it's predecessors as each party member has interchangeable armor pieces that customize the look according to its specification and class.

                        The protagonist of this installment is known as the Inquisitor. Players are able to choose from multiple races, and the game recognizes game flags, class flags, or a combination of the two depending on the situation. The advent of multiple player races by necessity requires different body and armor models for the protagonist.
